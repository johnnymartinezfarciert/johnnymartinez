								Part 1a: Create a webpage that contains a script, using the for statement, that calculates the product and sum of every third integer from 5 to 20 inclusive and then displays the results, along with some accompanying text.

	(Note: You should print a line that contains the result of 5 * 8 * 11 * 14 * 17 * 20 and a second line that contains the result of 5 + 8 + 11 + 14 + 17 + 20).

	Part 1b: On the same webpage as Part 1a, create a script, using the while or do while statement, that calculates the product and sum of every fourth integer from 3 to 31 inclusive and then displays the results, along with some accompanying text.

	(Note: You should print a line that contains the result of 3 * 7 * 11 * 15 * 19 * 23 * 27 * 31 and a second line that contains the result of 3 + 7 + 11 + 15 + 19 + 23 + 27 + 31).

	Use jQuery UI to allow the user to drag an element to a specific area of the page.</td>

	      Create a webpage that contains a script that will determine the gross pay for each of six employees. The company pays "straight time" for the first 40 hours worked by each employee and pays "time and a half" for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours. You are given a list of the employees of the company, the number of hours worked last week and the hourly rate of each employee. Your script should input this information for each employee, determine the employee's gross pay and then displays the employee's gross pay. Be sure to round the outputted results to 2 decimal places. You should also check for valid input and right-justify all amounts. Use form text boxes to input the data. </td>

				Create a webpage that contains a script that will calculate compound interest on a principal of $1000 for interest rates of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10%, for years 1 through 10. The formula to use is :

P is the principal (the initial amount you borrow or deposit)

r is the annual rate of interest (percentage)

n is the number of years the amount is deposited

A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest

A = P(1 + r)n

Output in table format the year followed by the total amount calculated for each of the interest rates of 5% - 10%. (Be sure to include cents.) Your 3rd column should contain the corresponding interest rate.

				A mail-order house sells five different products whose retail prices are as follows: product 1, $2.98, product 2, $4.50, product 3, $9.98, product 4, $4.49, product 5, $6.87. Create a webpage that contains a script that inputs the following:

a) Product number (1 through 5)
b) Quantity sold for that product - (for the week)

Your script should use a switch statement to help determine the retail price for each product and should calculate and display the retail amount for each product and the total retail amount of all the products sold last week. Use form input boxes to obtain the product numbers (hard coded as 1-5) and the quantity sold for each product from the user.

	    <td>
				Create a webpage that contains a script that uses a form text box for one of three different list formats. Use jQuery to show/hide instructions and validate input data. Use the following to determine which format is desired. Your script should use a switch statement to help determine this.

1 - unordered list
2 - ordered number list
3 - ordered letter list

After determining which list format has been chosen, write an appropriate header line and then use a for statement to write 3 lines in the chosen list format.

	Create a webpage that contains a script that uses repetition and switch statements to print the song "The Twelve Days of Christmas". One switch statement should be used to print the day (i.e., "First," "Second," etc.). A separate switch statement should be used to print the remainder of each verse. Use jQuery to add some animation to the page using a christmas image.

Create a webpage that contains a script that reads in the size of the side of a square and displays a hollow square of that size constructed of asterisks. Your script should work for squares of all side sizes between 2 and 10. Display an error message if the user enters any number that is not between 2 and 10. Be sure that the output looks like a square. A common error is having the top and bottom row of asterisks appear to be smaller than the sides.
